# Communication
Studies on communication, writing and presentation.

## Introduction
I never thought about improving my communication skills on my undergraduate years because of the nature of it being a self studing lone race. Although journey of a Ph.D. seems like more closed and lonelier, I belive it is quite opposite.
It is journey of co-working over multidisciplinary reasearchers and I need to convince my work to the others with various knowledge backgound. That is why I created this repo, to learn clear communication skills and share the journey.
Altough as of 2025 there being a lot of sophiscated writing assistant tools for researcher, I belive that it the main reason for me to study the basic to be more like myself.

Career advice / support
So good they can’t ignore you (I love this book and find it comforting)
The professor is In: the essential guide for turning your PhD into a job (best book on the market for the US job market - does not apply to all locations, so use advisedly if you are not applying in there)
How to be an academic (I wrote this one!)
Social media for academics (most thoughtful text written on a difficult subject)
Teaching what you don’t know (incredibly useful, even if you are teaching stuff you know well)
Successful Careers Beyond the Lab (thanks to Alex Burns: “How research and scientific training can open up diverse ‘post-ac’ (post-academic) career pathways in government and industry”)
A PhD Is Not Enough! A Guide to Survival in Science (thanks to Alex Burns: “A classic guide to managing Post-Doctoral careers in science: advice on career planning, research programs, grants, and publications.”)
Promotion and tenure confidential (thanks to Alex Burns: “A ‘behind closed doors’ look at how promotion and tenure processes actually work.”)

### Productivity / getting research done
